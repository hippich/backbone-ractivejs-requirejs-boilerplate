Backbone + Ractive + Require Boilerplate
========================================

This meant to be used as a starting point, not a reference design or a library. Clone it and start hacking right there, or
merge into your own large project just pieces of it.

Demo - https://cdn.rawgit.com/hippich/backbone-ractivejs-requirejs-boilerplate/bc358ed24a390326f88fcabb6df0729212d4b17b/index.html#/dashboard

To test it locally:

```
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 9999
```

And open it in the browser - http://localhost:9999/#/dashboard
